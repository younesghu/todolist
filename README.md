Simple todo-List that allows the user to make an account and link his/her to do tasks to it with the ability to log in and out, in addition to the ability to adding or removing tasks.
This project is a bit different than other ones because, every user is saved inside of "Users" table and each user has his own "Tasks" table that is connected to its user with "user_id" variable so as to keep each user's tasks saved and well maintained even if you refresh your browser.
